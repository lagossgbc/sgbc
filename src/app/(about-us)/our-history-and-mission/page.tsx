        Our History
      </h2>
      <p className="text-justify mt-4 mb-2 text-base">
        In 1994 a group of Christians attended a Family Radio program where they
        heard the true gospel preached; in order to continue to hear the truth
        preached they decided to keep meeting with Tony Okoroh as coordinator.
        By 1997, the group became known as Sovereign Grace Bible Fellowship and
        started to meet regularly on Sundays in a classroom at a school in
        Anifowoshe Ikeja and later on Adegbola Street also in Anifowoshe. They
        prayed together, held Bible studies and listened to taped sermons from
        Mount Zion Bible Church, Florida, and Christ Bible Church, San Francisco
        for a while until they were ready - with oversight from other reformed
        churches- to covenant together.
      </p>
      <p className="text-justify mb-2 text-base">
        {" "}
        The first 12 regular attendees covenanted together to become Sovereign
        Grace Bible Church and laid hands on Tony Okoroh to become the Pastor in
        2002. Since then we have seen steady growth and now have a membership of
        over 150 adults, are blessed with lots of children and regular
        attendees. In 2010, Pst. Femi Sonuga-Oye became our second elder while
        Pst. Osagie Azeta and Pst. Osinachi Nwoko were ordained in 2019.
      </p>
      <p className="text-justify mb-2 text-base">
        {" "}
        Through efforts in Tract Distribution (since 1994), Blessed Children
        Ministry (since 1999), Lagos Bible Conference (since 2002), and Christ
        Pastor’s Seminary (since 2010) now Grace and Truth Theological Seminary,
        we hope to share the truth of God’s word with our city and nation.
      </p>
      <p className="text-justify mb-2 text-base">
        The Lord God is still working in us and through us each day and we are
        excited and hopeful that He would use us in more ways.

        Our Mission
      </h2>
      <p className="text-justify mb-2 text-base">
        Our calling is to preach the whole counsel of God that will cause us and
        all around us to live to God’s glory.
      </p>
      <p className="text-justify mb-2 text-base">
        {" "}
        At SGBC, we want to do everything to the glory of God. That the way we
        live and love might tell everyone of the great work of salvation which
        God has worked in our lives.
      </p>
      <p className="text-justify mb-2 text-base">
        It is our goal to be of one mind as it pertains to life and godliness so
        we encourage each other to attend weekly worship services, be part of a
        neighbourhood small group, and find ways to serve one another, the
        communities in which we live, and our nation.
