      "Our view of ministry is driven by our desire to see God’s children grounded and strengthened in the faith once and for all delivered to the saints to the end that they grow in likeness to the Saviour of their souls. The natural consequence of this, we believe, are saints who are equipped for the work of the ministry, to the building up of the of Christ (Eph. 4:12).",
      "Having observed in Scripture, Gospel applications made to various age cadres in the church (Tit. 2 and 1 Jn.2), we feel it necessary to establish ministries along these clear lines. We believe this is the best way to cater to the needs of God’s children.",

Elders are the ones charged with the responsibility of governing the church as under-sheph ;erds and will be required to account for this role to the Chief Shepherd Himself (Heb. 13:17, Tit. 1:7, 1Pet. 5:5). This oversight over ministries suggests that in practical terms a ministry will not necessarily decide how to run its affairs on its own. Every ministry must defer to the elders on all such matters. This means that the emphasis that a ministry takes must be identified and governed by the elder in charge. However, all other elders must be kept apprised about what is happening so that unity may be maintained.",

This way, ministry members see their elders as being an example of what a ministry member is and what a ministry member should be doing.",
          "However, elders may delegate certain responsibilities to qualified individuals. This principle of delegated leadership is established in the Scriptures (Ex. 18 and Acts 6) and is applicable to ministries. Ministries, therefore, can have leadership established under the oversight of elders. These individuals, however, may be removed from their position if they are found wanting in their assigned duties.",
          "Plans for each ministry is to be established and agreed upon at the beginning of the year. At the end of the year, a performance report is to be shared with the eldership board before presentation is made to the church.",
